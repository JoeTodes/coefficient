# FAQ

## What kinds of problems does coEfficient Solutions specialize in solving?

Simple answer: the _human_ kinds of problems

Long answer: The big, ubiquitous problems most businesses face are already solved by a robust ecosystem of software tools; tasks like inventory management, e-commerce, and accounting are well-suited to generalized, one-size-fits-all solutions. It's the smaller, incredibly niche, and often totally unique to your business problems that we love to solve. What are you wasting time doing? What inconvenient or annoying processes get in the way of your productivity? Are you working with data manually or with some archaic set of spreadsheets? These are the kinds of things we want to help you with.

## Why Web Applications?

In the past, most small software solutions would be developed as desktop applications. The general shift to e-commerce and remote work as primary factors in our modern business context has driven the development of web tools and the supporting infrastructure to make web applications well suited to meeting the needs previously filled by desktop applications. Web technologies have always afforded the ability to craft intuitive and responsive user interfaces that work on a variety of devices, which coupled with a robust ecosystem of tools for managing features like user authentication and remote database management, makes web applications a good choice even for offline software solutions.

## Can you help me with SEO (Search Engine Optimization)?

In some ways, absolutely! In other ways, probably not!

SEO is an incredibly nebulous and complex problem to solve. Some aspects fall under our area of expertise; there are technical, structural elements of any web page that can affect your SEO and we're happy to help identify and fix any of these kinds of issues with your website. You can either book a private session to get one-on-one support and a full technical audit of your website or you can attend one of our small group tech-help sessions. Don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact) for more information!

The other half of SEO (and by far the more complicated half) is all about **content**. The time-tested wisdom in SEO has always been that _content is king_ (or queen) and the crafting of web content for SEO is a branch of technical arcana that falls outside our area of expertise. If your site is checking all the technical SEO boxes but still not ranking well, your best bet is a **Digital Marketing** expert, which we, unfortunately, are not.

## What is a Content Management System (CMS) and does my website need one?

Simply put, a CMS offers non-coders the ability to add and/or edit the content of a website without needing to learn how the underlying code works. All of our business landing page sites come with a CMS built-in that you can log in to through a secret part of your website so you can edit any of the text sections of your site (often referred to as the _copy_).

Image you are updating your pricing structure. Rather than contacting us to make the changes to your website (which you could still do under our on-going customer service policy), you can instead just login to the CMS section of your site, make the changes you need, hit save, and wait a few minutes for the update to take effect.

If your site also includes a blog, the CMS allows you to write and publish your posts. The underlying code will automatically take care of generating a new webpage for each post as well as adding them to the main list/gallery of posts.

## Is coEfficient Solutions a web/brand design studio?

Our focus in on developing the underlying architecture and utility of applications and web pages to save you time and money. While we employ standard best practices for frontend UI, we love working with designers to infuse your app with your business's unique identity.
