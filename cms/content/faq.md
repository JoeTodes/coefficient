## Utility Applications

### What kinds of problems does coEfficient Solutions specialize in solving?

Simple answer: the *human* kinds of problems

Long answer: The big, ubiquitous problems most businesses face are already solved by a robust ecosystem of software tools; tasks like inventory management, e-commerce, and accounting are well-suited to generalized, one-size-fits-all solutions. It's the smaller, incredibly niche, and often totally unique to your business problems that we love to solve. What are you wasting time doing? What inconvenient or annoying processes get in the way of your productivity? Are you working with data manually or with some archaic set of spreadsheets? These are the kinds of things we want to help you with

### Why Web Applications?

In the past, most small software solutions would be developed as desktop applications. The general shift to e-commerce and remote work as primary factors in our modern business context has driven the development of web tools and the supporting infrastructure to make web applications well suited to meeting the needs previously filled by desktop applications. Web technologies have always afforded the ability to craft intuitive and responsive user interfaces that work on a variety of devices, which coupled with a robust ecosystem of tools for managing features like user authentication and remote database management, makes web applications a good choice even for offline software solutions.

## Business Pages

### Why not use Squarespace/Wix/Show-It/etc?

All-in-one solutions like Squarespace, Wix, and others are certainly a good fit for some clients (otherwise they wouldn't be so popular) but you should be aware of what you are paying for. Since hosting simple websites is virtually free these days, the monthly fee these services charge really covers is access to their professionally designed templates (usually with some amount of customization tools), and 24/7 customer support. If you value the ability to go in and tinker with the structure of your website frequently, or plan on making use of more complex yet fairly standardized features like e-commerce, then paying monthly for one of these services might be a good fit. If you would rather focus your time and energy on your work-product, it the monthly fee for a service like Squarespace or Wix is often not worth what you will get out of it. 

Apart from the monthly fee, the other main downside of these services is that in many ways you are locked into their ecosystem. If down the road you want to leave Squarespace, for example, you will have to pretty much start from scratch. While you own your domain name and any content on your site (text, images, and any other assets), the layout and underlying structure belongs to Squarespace.

When you work with **coEfficient Solutions** for your business landing page, you own 100% of the code and can do with it as you please. We will also help you make an account and set up hosting with our standard hosting platform, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which for most cases will completely free hosting, but since you own the code, you can take it to any other hosting solution if you chose. With **coEfficient Solutions**, your one-time development fee covers the development of your site and hosting setup described above, a built-in Content Management System (see below), life-time[^1] customer service (includes bug fixes, small cosmetic changes, and basic SEO consulting).

### What is a Content Management System (CMS) and does my website need one?

Simply put, a CMS offers non-coders the ability to add and/or edit the content of a website without needing to learn how the underlying code works. All of our business landing page sites come with a CMS built-in that you can log in to through a secret part of your website so you can edit any of the text sections of your site (often referred to as the *copy*).

Image you are updating your pricing structure. Rather than contacting us to make the changes to your website (which you could still do under our on-going customer service policy), you can instead just login to the CMS section of your site, make the changes you need, hit save, and wait a few minutes for the update to take effect.

If your site also includes a blog, the CMS allows you to write and publish your posts. The underlying code will automatically take care of generating a new webpage for each post as well as adding them to the main list/gallery of posts.

### Is coEfficient Solutions a web/brand design studio?

Our focus in on developing the underlying architecture and utility of applications and web pages to save you time and money. While we employ standard best practices for frontend UI, we love working with designers to infuse your app with your business's unique identity.
