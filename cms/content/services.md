# Services

## Every project is unique

Our pricing is as custom as the solutions we provide. Based on the complexity, requirements, scale, and timeline, we'll discuss a fee that makes sense for the scope of the project. However, in general projects can be lumped into three main categories:

## Business Landing Pages

### $500CAD - $1000CAD

Simple, single or multi-page websites to advertize your business. These may include:

- A [Content Management System (CMS)](/about/#what-is-a-content-management-system-cms-and-does-my-website-need-one) for editing page content and/or blog or portfolio publishing
- A contact form for users to get in touch directly
- Standard SEO best practices to make it easier for search engines to index your site
- Free[^1] hosting

## Basic Utility Application

### ~\$1000CAD

Solving fairly straightforward problems, often to increase efficiency in day-to-day tasks. These may include:

- Data handling, entry, visualization, or reporting
- User authentication
- Custom blogging features

## Industrial Scale Application

### $3000CAD - $10000CAD

More complex and/or larger scale projects. These might replace entire systems or workflows, involve the handling of complex, relational datasets, and/or require ongoing development support.
